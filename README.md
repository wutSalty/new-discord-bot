# new-discord-bot

As it says on the box, trial run of a Discord bot using the guts of an old bot, hence new-discord-bot. 
Written in TypeScript so hopefully, ideally, maybe, type safe (no guarantees).
This thing is also just running on my laptop so it's going to have 0 uptime.

## Commands
- /ping is your basic echo command.
- /user gets your username and join date.
- /server gets your server name and member count.
- /schedule powered by [splatoon3.ink](https://splatoon3.ink)'s API for Splatoon 3 schedule. Returns details about the current/upcoming rotations for Turf/Series/Opens/X/Challenge/Salmon.

## Other
I hope I haven't leaked any env files or tokens cause that would be a very big problem.
